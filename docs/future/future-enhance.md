# **Future Enhancements for AITaskMaster**
Congratulations on successfully deploying and scaling AITaskMaster! As we look to the future, there are numerous exciting possibilities to further enhance and expand our AI-powered task management system. Let's explore some potential future enhancements that could take AITaskMaster to the next level.

## **1. Natural Language Processing for Task Creation**
Implement advanced NLP capabilities to allow users to create tasks using natural language input.

``` { .yaml .copy }
# app/ai_models/nlp_task_creator.py
from transformers import pipeline

class NLPTaskCreator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-base", tokenizer="t5-base")

    def parse_task(self, user_input: str) -> dict:
        prompt = f"Convert to task format: {user_input}"
        result = self.nlp(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)[0]['generated_text']
        
        # Parse the generated text into task components
        task_components = result.split(', ')
        task_dict = {}
        for component in task_components:
            key, value = component.split(': ')
            task_dict[key.lower()] = value

        return task_dict

# Usage in FastAPI route
@app.post("/tasks/create-from-text")
async def create_task_from_text(text: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    nlp_creator = NLPTaskCreator()
    task_dict = nlp_creator.parse_task(text)
    task = schemas.TaskCreate(**task_dict)
    return crud.create_task(db=db, task=task)
```

> This enhancement allows users to create tasks by describing them in natural language. The system uses advanced NLP to parse the input and extract relevant task details.

## **2. AI-Powered Task Delegation and Team Collaboration**
Extend AITaskMaster to support team collaboration with intelligent task delegation based on team members' skills and workload.

``` { .yaml .copy }
# app/ai_models/team_collaborator.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class TeamCollaborator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def calculate_task_user_fit(self, task_vector, user_vectors):
        task_vector_scaled = self.scaler.fit_transform(task_vector.reshape(1, -1))
        user_vectors_scaled = self.scaler.transform(user_vectors)
        similarities = cosine_similarity(task_vector_scaled, user_vectors_scaled)
        return similarities[0]

    def suggest_team_member(self, task, team_members):
        task_vector = np.array([task.priority, task.estimated_time, task.complexity])
        user_vectors = np.array([[u.avg_task_priority, u.avg_task_time, u.skill_level] for u in team_members])
        
        fit_scores = self.calculate_task_user_fit(task_vector, user_vectors)
        workload_scores = np.array([1 / (u.current_workload + 1) for u in team_members])
        
        combined_scores = fit_scores * workload_scores
        best_match_index = np.argmax(combined_scores)
        
        return team_members[best_match_index]

# Usage in FastAPI route
@app.post("/tasks/{task_id}/delegate")
async def delegate_task(task_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    task = crud.get_task(db, task_id)
    team_members = crud.get_team_members(db, task.team_id)
    
    collaborator = TeamCollaborator()
    suggested_member = collaborator.suggest_team_member(task, team_members)
    
    task.assigned_to = suggested_member.id
    db.commit()
    
    return {"message": f"Task delegated to {suggested_member.name}"}
```

> This enhancement introduces AI-powered task delegation, considering team members' skills, current workload, and task requirements to optimize team collaboration and productivity.

## **3. Predictive Analytics for Project Management**
Implement predictive analytics to forecast project completion times, potential bottlenecks, and resource allocation needs.

``` { .yaml .copy }
# app/ai_models/project_predictor.py
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class ProjectPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    def train(self, historical_data):
        X = historical_data[['num_tasks', 'total_estimated_time', 'team_size', 'project_complexity']]
        y = historical_data['actual_completion_time']
        
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        accuracy = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def predict_completion_time(self, project_data):
        prediction = self.model.predict(project_data)
        return prediction[0]

    def identify_bottlenecks(self, project_tasks):
        task_dependencies = self.build_dependency_graph(project_tasks)
        critical_path = self.find_critical_path(task_dependencies)
        return [task for task in critical_path if task.estimated_time > task.average_completion_time]

    def suggest_resource_allocation(self, project_tasks, available_resources):
        # Implementation of resource allocation algorithm
        pass

# Usage in FastAPI route
@app.get("/projects/{project_id}/predictions")
async def get_project_predictions(project_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    project = crud.get_project(db, project_id)
    project_tasks = crud.get_project_tasks(db, project_id)
    
    predictor = ProjectPredictor()
    historical_data = crud.get_historical_project_data(db)
    predictor.train(historical_data)
    
    project_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'num_tasks': [len(project_tasks)],
        'total_estimated_time': [sum(task.estimated_time for task in project_tasks)],
        'team_size': [len(set(task.assigned_to for task in project_tasks))],
        'project_complexity': [project.complexity]
    })
    
    predicted_completion_time = predictor.predict_completion_time(project_data)
    bottlenecks = predictor.identify_bottlenecks(project_tasks)
    
    return {
        "predicted_completion_time": predicted_completion_time,
        "potential_bottlenecks": [task.id for task in bottlenecks],
        "resource_allocation_suggestions": predictor.suggest_resource_allocation(project_tasks, project.available_resources)
    }
```

> This predictive analytics enhancement provides valuable insights for project management, including completion time predictions, bottleneck identification, and resource allocation suggestions.

## **4. Integration with IoT Devices for Context-Aware Task Management**
Extend AITaskMaster to integrate with IoT devices, enabling context-aware task suggestions and automated task tracking.

``` { .yaml .copy }
# app/iot_integration/device_manager.py
from paho.mqtt import client as mqtt_client
import json

class IoTDeviceManager:
    def __init__(self, broker, port, topic):
        self.broker = broker
        self.port = port
        self.topic = topic
        self.client = self.connect_mqtt()

    def connect_mqtt(self):
        def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
            if rc == 0:
                print("Connected to MQTT Broker!")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to connect, return code {rc}")

        client = mqtt_client.Client()
        client.on_connect = on_connect
        client.connect(self.broker, self.port)
        return client

    def subscribe(self, on_message):
        self.client.subscribe(self.topic)
        self.client.on_message = on_message

    def start(self):
        self.client.loop_forever()

# Usage in FastAPI startup event
iot_manager = IoTDeviceManager('mqtt.example.com', 1883, 'aitaskmaster/devices/#')

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
        data = json.loads(msg.payload.decode())
        process_iot_data(data)

    iot_manager.subscribe(on_message)
    iot_manager.start()

def process_iot_data(data):
    if data['type'] == 'location':
        suggest_location_based_tasks(data['user_id'], data['location'])
    elif data['type'] == 'activity':
        update_task_progress(data['user_id'], data['activity'])

def suggest_location_based_tasks(user_id, location):
    # Implementation to suggest tasks based on user's location
    pass

def update_task_progress(user_id, activity):
    # Implementation to automatically update task progress based on user's activity
    pass
```

> This IoT integration allows AITaskMaster to receive real-time data from various devices, enabling context-aware task suggestions and automated task tracking based on users' locations and activities.
