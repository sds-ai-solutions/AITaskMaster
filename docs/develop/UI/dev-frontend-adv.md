# **Frontend Development for AITaskMaster - Advanced Features**
Welcome back to the frontend development phase of AITaskMaster! Since you've already completed the basic setup, let's dive into some advanced features to make your AI-powered task management system even more powerful and user-friendly.

## **1. AI Insights Dashboard**

Let's create a new component that showcases AI-generated insights about the user's task management habits and productivity.

``` { .yaml .copy }
// src/components/AIInsightsDashboard.js
import React from 'react';
import { Paper, Typography, Grid } from '@material-ui/core';
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';

const AIInsightsDashboard = ({ insights }) => {
  return (
    
      AI Insights
      
        
          Productivity Score: {insights.productivityScore}/10
          {insights.productivityComment}
        
        
          Task Completion Trend
          
            
              
              
              
              
              
              
            

          
        
      
    
  );
};

export default AIInsightsDashboard;
```

> This component displays AI-generated insights, including a productivity score and a chart showing task completion trends. It uses Recharts for data visualization.

## **2. AI-Powered Task Suggestions**
Let's add a feature that suggests tasks based on the user's current workload and past behavior.

``` { .yaml .copy }
// src/components/TaskSuggestions.js
import React from 'react';
import { List, ListItem, ListItemText, ListItemSecondaryAction, IconButton, Paper, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
import { Add as AddIcon } from '@material-ui/icons';

const TaskSuggestions = ({ suggestions, onAddSuggestion }) => {
  return (
    
      AI Task Suggestions
      
        {suggestions.map((suggestion, index) => (
          
            
            
               onAddSuggestion(suggestion)}>
                
              
            
          
        ))}
      
    
  );
};

export default TaskSuggestions;
```

> This component displays AI-generated task suggestions and allows users to add them to their task list with a single click.

## **3. Enhanced Dashboard with AI Features**
Now, let's update our Dashboard component to include these new AI-powered features:

``` { .yaml .copy }
// src/components/Dashboard.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Container, Grid, Paper, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
import TaskList from './TaskList';
import TaskForm from './TaskForm';
import AIInsightsDashboard from './AIInsightsDashboard';
import TaskSuggestions from './TaskSuggestions';
import { getTasks, createTask, getAIInsights, getTaskSuggestions } from '../services/api';

function Dashboard() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  const [insights, setInsights] = useState(null);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTasks();
    fetchAIInsights();
    fetchTaskSuggestions();
  }, []);

  const fetchTasks = async () => {
    const fetchedTasks = await getTasks();
    setTasks(fetchedTasks);
  };

  const fetchAIInsights = async () => {
    const fetchedInsights = await getAIInsights();
    setInsights(fetchedInsights);
  };

  const fetchTaskSuggestions = async () => {
    const fetchedSuggestions = await getTaskSuggestions();
    setSuggestions(fetchedSuggestions);
  };

  const handleCreateTask = async (taskData) => {
    const newTask = await createTask(taskData);
    setTasks([...tasks, newTask]);
  };

  const handleAddSuggestion = async (suggestion) => {
    const newTask = await createTask(suggestion);
    setTasks([...tasks, newTask]);
    setSuggestions(suggestions.filter(s => s.id !== suggestion.id));
  };

  return (
    
      
        AITaskMaster Dashboard
      
      
        
          
            
          
          {insights && }
        
        
          
            
          
          
        
      
    
  );
}

export default Dashboard;
```

> This updated Dashboard now includes the AI Insights and Task Suggestions components, providing users with a more comprehensive and intelligent task management experience.

## **4. Updated API Service**
Let's update our API service to include the new AI-powered endpoints:

``` { .yaml .copy }
// src/services/api.js
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';  // Replace with your actual API URL

export const getTasks = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/tasks/`);
  return response.data;
};

export const createTask = async (taskData) => {
  const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/tasks/`, taskData);
  return response.data;
};

export const getAIInsights = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/ai/insights/`);
  return response.data;
};

export const getTaskSuggestions = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/ai/suggestions/`);
  return response.data;
};

```

> This updated API service now includes functions to fetch AI insights and task suggestions from our backend.

## **UI Preview**

> ## **AI Assistant**
>
> Excellent work on implementing these advanced AI-powered features! Here are some additional ideas to further enhance AITaskMaster:
>
> - Implement a natural language processing feature that allows users to add tasks using voice commands or free-text input.
> - Create an AI-powered "Focus Mode" that temporarily hides less important tasks based on the user's current priorities and deadlines.
> - Develop a machine learning model that learns from user behavior to improve task prioritization and time estimation over time.
> - Add a collaborative feature that uses AI to suggest task delegations within a team based on each member's skills and current workload.
> - Implement an AI-driven notification system that sends smart reminders based on task importance, due dates, and user productivity patterns.
> 
> Remember to continuously gather user feedback and iterate on these AI features to ensure they're providing real value to your users.

Congratulations on implementing these advanced AI-powered features in AITaskMaster! Your task management system now offers intelligent insights and suggestions, making it a powerful tool for boosting productivity.
